# Project: Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project aims to predict telecom customer churn and provide actionable insights to reduce churn using machine learning.

##  Objective :
To build a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of leaving the telecom service, based on their service usage and complaint patterns.

##  Dataset :
- Total records: 3,333
- Features include call durations, service plans, charges, complaints, and churn labels.

##  Technologies Used :
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- SQL (offline aggregations)
- Random Forest Classifier
- ELI5 for model interpretability
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Project Highlights :
- Feature engineering: total_calls, total_minutes, total_charges
- EDA insights: High churn among customers with many complaints or international plan
- Random Forest model with 97.45% accuracy
- Customer segmentation:
  - At Risk (churn_prob > 0.7)
  - Neutral (0.3–0.7)
  - Loyal (< 0.3)
- Exported predictions: `churn_segments.csv`

##  Deliverables :
- `CUstomer_telecom_churn.ipynb`
- `churn_segments.csv`
- `Customer_telecom_churn_ppt.pptx`
- `Telecom_Churn_Report.pdf`
